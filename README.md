This is a simple JavaScript based game, in which the object is to collect three gems and then proceed to the water.

Use the arrow keys to move the player. The player must avoid the bugs, lava, and vines, otherwise the player loses a life.

There is a three minute time limit. The timer begins its countdown when the start button is clicked.

I am not sure what "running instructions" are, but I will try to explain things as clearly as possible. 

Click on the start button using your mouse. Again, the timer begins its countdown when the start button is clicked, and it resets when the player either wins the game, quits the game, or loses all of their lives. Use the up arrow to move the player (the elf-like character) towards the water (up the screen). Use the left arrow button on the keyboard to move the player left. Use the right arrow button on the keyboard to move the player to the right. Use the down arrow button on the keyboard to move down. The player is confined to the playing field, which is the canvas area.

For a description of where to locate the arrow buttons on your keyboard, refer to the following page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys

Gems are collected by running the player into them. If a gem is collected the number in the upper right hand corner of the canvas (it is called "Gems Collected") increases by one. It is necessary to collect at least 3 gems in order to win the game, but more than 3 can be obtained. The gems that the player must collect move at random, so you must be quick in order to catch them.

The timer is located in the upper center of the page. It starts at 3:00 indicating three minutes. It decreases one second each second, as most countdown timers do.

The player begins with 3 lives. A life is lost if a player collides with any of the bug enemies, walks into the lava tiles, crosses into the vine field, or answers the Gate-keeper's question incorrectly. If all 3 lives are lost, the game is over, and it resets.
