This is a simple JavaScript based game, in which the object is to collect three gems and then proceed to the water.

Use the arrow keys to move the player. The player must avoid the bugs, lava, and vines, otherwise the player loses a life.

There is a three minute time limit.

The gems that the player must collect move at random, so you must be quick in order to catch them.
